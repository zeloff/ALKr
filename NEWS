ALKr 0.5.1
==========

* `ALKr` objects now have `name` and `description` slots

ALKr 0.5
==========

* New S4 class `summary_ALKr`

ALKr 0.4.1
==========

* Fix bug on `inverse_ALK.R`

ALKr 0.4
========

* `hoenig` is now also implemented in C++ and runs about 6.5x faster

ALKr 0.3
========

* Added `age_slicing` for simple application of the knife-edge method, using
  von Bertalanffy's growth equation to convert length distributions in age
  distributions
* Added `mixed_dist` to extract age distributions from age-overlapping length
  distributions, using the `mixdist` package.

ALKr 0.2
========

* Now using `Rcpp`. `gascuel` is the first algorithm partially implemented in
  C++, resulting in a median speedup of about 15x.
* Removed `age_classes` and `length_classes` slot from the 'ALKr' class, as they
  are redundant. All methods generating `ALKr` objects are assumed to pass them
  as respectively column and rownames of the `alk` slot.

ALKr 0.1
========

* Initial version.
